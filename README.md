## THIS IS A BETA PROJECT - SEE TODOS for CURRENT GOALS

# React + Vite + PWA

This app explores how to get React and Vite working with some PWA updating and
Dexie.js data persistance. 

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Testing using localhost

Simple testing on local device
> npm run preview
> npm run dev

Host from device
> npm run dev -- --host

## Setup as a PWA
Forces updates such that as a new update is pushed to github, our app will update
specified fields

To launch the app:
> npm run build

Then simply push the new dist folder to the repo
